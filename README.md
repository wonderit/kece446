### How to Set up a Database

    # start MySQL. Will create an empty database on first start
    $ mysql-ctl start
    
    # stop MySQL
    $ mysql-ctl stop
    
    # run the MySQL interactive shell
    $ mysql-ctl cli
        
    # Install phpMyAdmin
    $ phpmyadmin-ctl install
    
After installing phpMyAdmin, you were given a link to access PHPMyAdmin which will follow the pattern of: https://[workspacename]-[username].c9users.io/phpmyadmin. From that link, you can login with your Cloud9 username and a blank password.
